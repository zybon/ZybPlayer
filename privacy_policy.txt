Welcome to the ZybPlayer!

This is an open source Android app developed by zybon. 

The source code is available (soon) on GitHub; the app is also available on Google Play.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, 
that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
All data (like saved lists) is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.
